A factor analysis on the responses of 468 Dutch union members about appropriate behavior during a strike produces two factors. The first factor reflects a ``solidarity norm'' favoring group solidarity; the second factor reflects a norm about the treatment of defecting colleagues, which we call the ``free-rider-punishment'' norm. Using OLS regression, we show that adherence to these norms significantly affects union members' willingness to strike, controlling for group identification, and past participation in strikes. This article contributes to a deeper understanding of how solidarity and free-rider-punishment affect future participation.},

  abstract = {This article studies the effect of recent labor market reforms on industrial relations in new democracies (1994\textendash 2003). The literature on labor politics posits two channels through which labor market deregulation may relate to industrial conflict. Wage deregulation may lower wage costs, increasing industrial conflict. Employment deregulation, however, can reduce the ability of workers to act collectively. Using methods uniquely suited for panel data analysis, the study reveals a number of important findings. First, whereas labor quiescence went hand in hand with relatively modest increases in earnings in a number of established democracies, modest wage increases are generally linked with more labor militancy in new democracies. Higher wage and employment regulation minimize wage reductions, lowering the incidence of strikes. Finally, wage regulation has the largest effect on aggregate wages and consequently on the incidence of strikes and lockouts.},

The Right has reformed labor law by obtaining partial support from employers' associations and unions\textemdash the social partners. The Left, by contrast, has relied on decentralized bargaining with the social partners because its political base would not have accepted flexibility-increasing legal reforms. The author examines critical episodes of reform in collective bargaining, unemployment insurance, and employment protection laws to show how the state has intervened in different ways depending on the political identity of the governing coalition.},

This textbook shows how to manage, describe, and model these kinds of data. It presents models for continuous and categorical dependent variables, focusing either on the level of these variables at different points in time or on their change over time. It covers fixed and random effects models, models for change scores and event history models. All statistical methods are explained in an application-centered style using research examples from scholarly journals, which can be replicated by the reader through data provided on the accompanying website. As all models are compared to each other, it provides valuable assistance with choosing the right model in applied research. The textbook is directed at master and doctoral students as well as applied researchers in the social sciences, psychology, business administration and economics. Readers should be familiar with linear regression and have a good understanding of ordinary least squares estimation.\mbox},

  abstract = {Despite a strengthening of collective labor rights in Latin America over the last 15 years, most labor movements in the region have lost power because neither the content nor the enforcement mechanisms associated with the labor reforms fully took into consideration the challenges presented by economic restructuring. Reforms facilitating union formation did not strengthen unions but instead increased union fragmentation. Collective bargaining structures did not respond to the exigencies of international outsourcing; and the initial round of reforms in the 1990s did not contemplate the need to strengthen labor law enforcement mechanisms at a time when heightened international competition created a need for greater state vigilance of labor standards. Recent reforms or proposed reforms hold more promise for labor, but truly union-friendly labor relations regimes require deeper changes. A review of several Latin American cases is followed by a closer examination of Brazil and El Salvador.},

This revival has seen a turn towards the Anglo-Saxon and international traditions of workplace and trade union studies, but it has been generally one-sided, focusing on the relatively successful experiences of trade unions' organized workers in formal sector workplaces. This has represented a considerable departure from the pre-2001 crisis research's agenda that focused on unemployment, poverty and the new forms of community based organizations generated by workers in non-work situations. The return to the institutionalized sphere in the analysis of work issues can be partially explained by the changes in the economic and political environment alongside the return to `normality' of the capital\textendash labour relationship. However, it also signals a tendency in labour studies, in Argentina and beyond, of using the union form as the main organizational frame of reference in the analyses of conflict and workers' representation.},

Comparing the extent of government involvement and the policy scope of social pacts, the chapter measures variation in the degree to which these countries relied on concertation as a mechanism of economic adjustment. The analysis of the necessary and sufficient conditions for pacts helps answer two key questions: why were pacts struck in some countries but not others; and second, is there more than one causal pathway behind these concerted agreements? The analysis reveals three pathways to pacts and demonstrates that a high economic problem load generates pacts only when combined with particular political and institutional conditions, namely the prevalence of electorally weak governments and moderately strong unions.},

  abstract = {Chapter 3 presents the first part of the book's analytical framework and examines more closely the politics of pact making, moving away from countries as units of analysis to individual negotiation episodes. The aim is to understand the outcomes of negotiations. The chapter presents a heuristic model of pact creation that incorporates the concepts of bounded rationality and unstable preferences within a standard bargaining framework. Its central argument is that the outcome of pact negotiations depends primarily on actors' perceptions of their relative power. The chapter identifies key indicators influencing these perceptions, and it outlines the main predictions of negotiation outcomes. The model suggests that where power disparities are visible but not excessively large, negotiations are likely to result in pacts. By contrast, where both leading negotiating parties believe that their respective position is strong (or alternatively weak), negotiations have a higher chance of failure.},

Based on an econometric analysis of the determinants of wage moderation in sixteen industrialized countries between 1974 and 2000, it argues that the organizational characteristics of trade unions have a significant impact on wage dynamics. Controlling for a number of institutional and economic factors, the countries in which trade union confederations directly involve workers in the process of collective bargaining ratification have on average lower wage growth relative to productivity than others. The authors also find that collective bargaining coordination and contract ratification magnify each other's wage-dampening effect. Through case studies of Ireland and Italy, the article examines the causal mechanisms underlying the uncovered statistical regularities and concludes that, particularly at a time in which classic political exchange is waning, worker involvement in contract ratification allows confederation leaders to resolve conflicting claims inside their organizations at lower wage levels than are achieved by a less participatory governance process.},

In contrast to current comparative political economy scholarship, which emphasizes the resilience of national institutions to common challenges and trends, it argues that despite a surface resilience of distinct national sets, all countries have been transformed in a neoliberal direction. Neoliberal transformation manifests itself not just as institutional deregulation but also as institutional conversion, as the functions associated with existing institutional forms change in a convergent direction. A key example is the institution of centralized bargaining, once the linchpin of an alternative, redistributive and egalitarian, model of negotiated capitalism, which has been reshaped in the past twenty years to fit the common imperative of liberalization.},

The primary empirical goal is to examine the evolution of industrial relations in Western Europe from the end of the 1970s up to the present. Its purpose is to evaluate the extent to which liberalization has taken hold of European industrial relations and institutions through five detailed, chapter-length studies, each focusing on a different country and including quantitative analysis. The book offers a comprehensive description and analysis of what has happened to the institutions that regulate the labor market, as well as the relations between employers, unions, and states in Western Europe since the collapse of the long postwar boom. The primary theoretical goal of this book is to provide a critical examination of some of the central claims of comparative political economy, particularly those involving the role and resilience of national institutions in regulating and managing capitalist political economies.},

At the structural level, social ties from non-profit foundations, cultural organizations, university boards, policy planning organizations, and private social clubs add unique ties to those established by interlocking directorates. In addition, the multiple configurations of these social affiliations increase the centrality and reduce the social distance among the corporate directors. Although visualizations of these social networks underscore the changing roles these extra-corporate ties play in uniting corporate directors, they cannot precisely capture the unique effects of ties created by social affiliations outside the boardroom. Utilizing the concepts of structural redundancy and multiplicity, the paper describes the unique contribution each set of ties makes in constructing the social mosaic of corporate America during the second half of the 20th century. The results indicate a dramatic reduction in the role private clubs play in supplementing corporate ties, and an equally significant rise in the importance of social ties generated by policy planning organizations.},

This gave the impression that she would create a favorable climate for social actors such as the Central Unitaria de Trabajadores (Unitary Workers' Federation\textendash CUT) to participate in the policy-making process. Instead, while the government treated the federation as labor's representative both for negotiating the minimum wage and for reaching agreements in important labor conflicts, these gains took place in a context in which the federation's action served the government's interests. In contrast to the situation under previous Concertaci\'on governments, the federation, like most social actors, was only allowed to express its points of view before the advisory commissions of technocrats that were entrusted with the responsibility of making policy. Paradoxically, however, the outcome was more favorable for its interests because of the disposition, at least discursively, of Bachelet's government to move forward on matters that the CUT had long considered ``pending issues.''Como candidata, Michelle Bachelet acert\'o que el suyo ser\'ia un gobierno ciudadano. Esto dio la impresi\'on de que crear\'ia un clima favorable para los actores sociales como la Central Unitaria de Trabajadores (CUT) para que participen en el proceso de la toma de decisiones. En vez, mientras el gobierno trataba con la federaci\'on como representante laboral en negociaciones sobre el salario m\'inimo y en acuerdos en importantes conflictos laborales, estos avances tomaron lugar en un contexto en donde las acciones de la federaci\'on serv\'ian al inter\'es del gobierno. Contrast\'andose con la situaci\'on en previos gobiernos concertacionistas, la federaci\'on, a igual que otros actores sociales, solo se le permit\'ia expresar sus puntos frente comisiones de asesoro en donde se confiaba la responsabilidad en la toma de decisiones a los tecn\'ocratas. Parad\'ojicamente y sin embargo el resultado fue mas favorable a sus intereses por causa de la disposici\'on, por lo menos divagadora, del gobierno de Bachelet en avanzar en materia que la CUT hab\'ia considerado por largo tiempo como ``asuntos pendientes.''},

  abstract = {This article explains cases of business collective action centered on the chief executive officer-based big business organization, the Business Council of Australia (BCA). The paper goes beyond Olsonian accounts of collective action by partly adopting and partly critiquing extant theoretical accounts that deal specifically with business collective action. Following Andrew Pblsky and others, it is found that business collective action is likely to be fostered only if a "daunting" set of conditions is in place, including the motivating role of perceived threats and opportunities, the effective discursive framing of issues and options, and the impetus provided by political entrepreneurs. The often critical role assigned to state elites in much of the extant literature in mobilizing business is criticized. In this Australian case the collective action centering on the BCA was primarily driven by business. Only later was such mobilization supported by state actors. In other words, the initial causal arrows run from business, not the state. A number of factors are found to have driven this business-centric dynamic. These include the role played by business political entrepreneurs, the impact of organizational conditions within the BCA, and wider ideological characteristics, especially the entrenched liberal character of business culture in Australia.},

This article examines efforts to negotiate social pacts in five nascent democratic regimes during their first five years in existence. Boolean analysis demonstrates the improbable nature of the social pacts negotiated in Spain; subsequent analysis aims at improving our understanding of why Spain successed. While social pacts have been minimally useful in most new democracies, inflation has been combatted more successfully in many countries (including some of the cases analyzed here) via the move from state capitalism toward more free-market policies. While market economics has been more successful in fighting inflation, the political effects of such policies have been mixed.},

  abstract = {This paper uses data from the Federal Elections Commission on political action committees, sponsored by Fortune 500 industrials in 1976 and 1980, to examine the determinants of business PAC size. Of the five groups of variables suggested by the extant PAC literature--availability of resources, free rider problems, material interests, previous campaign activity, and industry categories--just the measures of material interests have consistent and important effects on the level of firm political activity. Firms with the richest history of interaction with the state, top defense contractors, major acquirers of other businesses, and corporations prosecuted for criminal acts are the most politically active of large firms. Thus, while material interests are an important determinant of political action, this study suggests only interests tied to special long-term relationships with the state serve to increase the amount of political action taken by large firms. These results suggest that the pluralist-based theory of business political involvement, so widely accepted among contemporary PAC researchers, is of little utility for explaining firm differences in political activity.},

Data suggests that the latter practices are more likely to prevail in all of the countries examined despite assertions in the literature that new, more flexible work arrangements are transforming the old methods of production. Concludes with an evaluation of the opportunities which exist for the empowerment of trade union members at the workplace level under these circumstances.},

We find that the political power of the left is associated with more stringent labor regulations and more generous social security systems, and that socialist, French, and Scandinavian legal origin countries have sharply higher levels of labor regulation than do common law countries. However, the effects of legal origins are larger, and explain more of the variation in regulations, than those of politics. Heavier regulation of labor is associated with lower labor force participation and higher unemployment, especially of the young. These results are most naturally consistent with legal theories, according to which countries have pervasive regulatory styles inherited from the transplantation of legal systems.},

The resources considered are time, money, and civic skills--those communications and organizational capacities that are essential to political activity. These skills are not only acquired early in life but developed in the nonpolitical institutional settings of adult life: the workplace, organizations, and churches and synagogues. These resources are distributed differentially among groups defined by socioeconomic status. A two-stage least squares analysis shows these resources have powerful effects on overall political activity, thus explaining why socioeconomic status has traditionally been so powerful in predicting participation. We disaggregate overall activity into three kinds of acts: those that involve giving time, those that entail donating money, and voting. Each requires a different configuration of resources resulting in different patterns of stratification across various political acts.},

This hypothesis is tested on the basis of data which cover the period 1965\textendash 2012 and includes 28 countries. The results show that institutional change impairs the capacity to moderate unit labour cost growth significantly in the subsequent years following the change. This effect also holds for changes in both decentralization and centralization of institutions.},

Using data on political contributions by U. S. corporations and corporate elites between 1956 and 1982, we find little evidence of such a split within the capitalist class. During this period corporate elites exhibited a strong preference for conservative candidates, with little variation along the dimensions emphasized by corporate liberalism theory. Support for a rightward shift in U. S. state policy in the late 1970s and early 1980s was as equal, if not greater, among segments of the capitalist class that corporate liberalism theory labels as "liberal" as among those that it labels as "conservative." Whatever validity this theory of class segments may have had in earlier years, it provides a very poor map of political cleavages within the capitalist class during the last quarter century.},

Using quadratic assignment procedure (QAP) regression, the author shows that social ties formed through common membership on corporate boards contribute more to similarity of political behavior than commonalities of economic interests, such as those associated with operating in the same industry or the same geographic region. Moreover, the politically cohesive effects of directorship ties remain robust even as one moves several links down the chain of indirect ties that connect top corporate officers to one another. The study thus provides empirical support for the thesis that social networks among corporate elites facilitate political cohesion within the business community.},

  abstract = {The structure of labour markets is increasingly perceived as a determinant of the macroeconomic performance of a country. This article focuses on one aspect of labour markets, the degree of centralization of wage setting. The main conclusion is that extremes work best. Either highly centralized systems with national bargaining (such as in Austria and the Nordic countries), or highly decentralized systems with wage setting at the level of individual firms (such as in Japan, Switzerland and the US) seem to perform well. The worst outcomes with respect to employment may well be found in systems with an intermediate degree of centralization (such as in Belgium and the Netherlands). This conclusion is reasonably well supported by the available empirical evidence. It is also logical. Indeed, large and all-encompassing trade unions naturally recognize their market power and take into account both the inflationary and unemployment effects of wage increases. Conversely, unions operating at the individual firm or plant level have very limited market power. In intermediate cases, unions can exert some market power but are led to ignore the macroeconomic implications of their actions. These conclusions challenge the conventional wisdom which asserts that the more 'corporatist' is an economy, the better is its economic performance.},

The ability to generate a cohesive class identity, which arose in response to perceived threats from other producer factions, was critical for successful business collective action.

I use a maximum likelihood framework that provides a way to estimate distributions, evaluate model fit, and also test against alternative distributions. I consider a few theories that can create power law distributions in strike size, such as the joint costs model that posits strike size is inversely proportional to dispute costs. I find that the power law distribution fits the data for the number of lost person calendar days relatively well and is also more appropriate than the lognormal distribution. I also discuss the implications of my findings from a methodological, research, and policy perspective.},

  abstract = {U.S. corporations have shared members of their boards of directors since the early 1900s, creating a dense interlock network in which nearly every major corporation was connected through short paths and elevating a handful of well-connected directors to an influential ``inner circle.'' This network remained highly connected throughout the 20th century, serving as a mechanism for the rapid diffusion of information and practices and promoting elite cohesion. Some of the most well-established findings in the sociology of networks sprang from this milieu. In the 2000s, however, board recruiting practices changed: the authors find that well-connected directors became less preferred. As a result, the inner circle disappeared and companies became less connected to each other. Revisiting three classic studies, on the diffusion of corporate policies, on corporate executives' political unity, and on elite socialization, shows that established understandings of the effects of board interlocks on U.S. corporations, directors, and social elites no longer hold.},

  abstract = {Several studies have recently found that world income inequality declined during the closing years of the twentieth century. However, these studies feature a number of shortcomings, including the use of outdated national income estimates to measure inequality between countries, as well as sparse data to capture the smaller (but growing) component found within countries. The current study addresses these concerns and offers new estimates of world income inequality based on 151 countries covering 95 percent of the world's population during the 1990-2008 period. Overall, the results are fairly compatible with prior efforts, lending greater confidence to earlier findings. Nevertheless, the results suggest that prior studies covering the 1990s overestimate the decline in between-country inequality, but underestimate the rise in within-country inequality. Consequently, total inequality did not begin to decline substantially until the post-2000 era. After presenting these estimates, I then examine factors associated with income mobility among the 15,100 subnational percentile groups in my data set. The results suggest that (a) the negative effect of inequality is larger than the positive effect of economic growth among the poorest 25 percent of the world's population, and (b) late industrialization has contributed to income convergence between countries, while economic globalization has primarily served to stretch income distributions within nations.},

An examination of the campaign contributions of corporate PACs in the 1980 Congressional elections shows that: (1) businesses did follow differing political strategies, with marked differences in their relative commitments to pragmatism and ideology, (2) At the level of particular races, however, business was usually highly unified, (3) The degree of unity actually found is greater than that which would be expected given the differing corporate strategies, implying the possibility that inter-corporate communication is used to reduce direct and open political conflict.},

  abstract = {The concept of "corporatism" has usefully called attention to the importance of systems of interest representation based on non-competing groups that are officially sanctioned, subsidized, and supervised by the state. Yet these patterns have appeared in such a remarkable variety of political contexts that this concept may be too broad to be useful. On the basis of an analysis of the relationship between the state and organized labor in Latin America, this article argues that the concept of corporatism can be disaggregated so that it sheds light on rather than obscures the different power relationships and political contexts with which it is associated. The analysis focuses on the distinction between "inducements" extended by the state to win the cooperation of groups and "constraints" through which the state directly controls groups. This disaggregated approach enables one to distinguish more subtly among systems of group representation, to conceive of state-group relations in more interactive terms, and to gain insights into the larger political context.},

Although scholars have studied variation among left regimes and how these regimes differ from neoliberal-era predecessors, few have addressed the role of labour unions and labour policy under the Left. We argue that `bringing unions back in' to the analysis of left governments' performance sharpens distinctions with neoliberal governments and unsettles existing typologies. We review the labour policies of left governments in four countries\textemdash Chile, Brazil, Uruguay, and Argentina\textemdash to show how a labour lens enriches our understanding of left governments in the region.},

For older voters, turnout exceeded, on average, 90 percent in 2009; for those aged less than 30, it fell below 30 percent. Using individual survey data from 2006, 2008, and 2010, this article studies the current socioeconomic composition of the Chilean young electorate. First, it shows that the young electorate is class-biased. Income is highly correlated with both registration and turnout even after controlling for education. Second, it presents evidence that class bias for the whole electorate has been increasing over time, due to generational replacement. The results are not promising for Chile's democracy in the years to come, since equal participation is worsening over time.},

  abstract = {Across Europe, contemporary negotiated reforms of economic and social policy are increasingly characterized by a logic of information rather than a logic of exchange. Unlike in neo-corporatist bargaining over incomes policies, states negotiate with the social partners not primarily to secure their acquiescence, but instead to enlist their active assistance in designing and mobilizing support for substantial reforms of public policy. State policy-makers lack the combination of technical, relational, and local information necessary to design successful blueprints for reform, and so they are dependent on the social partners to acquire this information. In systems in which unions and employers' associations can exercise dialogic capacity, policy innovation is more likely to come from the propositions of the social partners than from political parties or bureaucrats. Using this logic, the article undertakes a pairwise comparison of episodes of negotiated reform: pensions in France and Italy, and vocational training in France and Germany.},

  abstract = {This essay highlights productive ways in which scholars have reanimated the concept of structural power to explain puzzles in international and comparative politics. Past comparative scholarship stressed the dependence of the state on holders of capital, but it struggled to reconcile this supposed dependence with the frequent losses of business in political battles. International relation (IR) scholars were attentive to the power of large states, but mainstream IR neglected the ways in which the structure of global capitalism makes large companies international political players in their own right. To promote a unified conversation between international and comparative political economy, structural power is best conceptualized as a set of mutual dependencies between business and the state. A new generation of structural power research is more attentive to how the structure of capitalism creates opportunities for some companies (but not others) vis-\`a-vis the state, and the ways in which that structure creates leverage for some states (but not others) to play off companies against each other. Future research is likely to put agents \textendash{} both states and large firms \textendash{} in the foreground as political actors, rather than showing how the structure of capitalism advantages all business actors in the same way against non-business actors.},

This article examines the relationship between gender and participation in seventeen Latin American countries. Many core results from research in the developed world hold in Latin America as well. Surprisingly, however, there is no evidence that economic development provides an impetus for more equal levels of participation. Instead, the most important contextual factors are civil liberties and women's presence among the visible political elite.},

  abstract = {The law regarding collective bargaining in Chile is both underdeveloped and weak, resulting on its coverage being very limited. However, in recent years, figures on collective bargaining coverage in Chile present two interesting developments. On one hand, they reveal a slight and sustained increase since 2006, and on the other hand, they surprise with a considerable increase since 2014. Apparently something has changed or works better in Chile, based on this new data. However, as we will explain in this paper, low coverage and precarious unionism have not ceased to be the general rule for the Chilean case and a decisive factor to take into account is its particular institutional setting. In light of the specificities of the Chilean reality, we propose a calculation mechanism that allows us to better observe the coverage of collective bargaining in the country. The data adjusted by this proposed correction indicate that by 2015 it reaches less than 10\% of wage earners in the private sector. If the average growth in the coverage of collective bargaining in the last 25 years has been maintained, Chile has little chance of getting out of the low level it currently exhibits in this area.},

Labor revitalization in a context of persistent informality raised the following question: Were there union organizing strategies that related formal workers to the broader working class community that included informal workers? This article answered the question through the analysis of union strategies from three formal sector firms located in one city of the Northern Gran Buenos Aires, Argentina, between 2005 and 2011. The evidence from this comparison showed that in two of the factories there were union strategies to reach the community. The existence of a grassroots democratic union in the shop floor appeared as a necessary condition for inclusive union strategies. The scale of those relations varied according to the geographical pattern of workers' housing, which was the result of the company's localization strategy.},

  abstract = {Class identity is a key mechanism in the explanation of class-based collective action. For decades, this was particularly relevant in Latin America, where objective class inequality was persistent and there was a long history of collective action, originating in the workplace and expressed through unions and labor parties. Despite persistent inequalities in the region, since the 1990s scholars increasingly claimed that the relation between objective class position and subjective class identification weakened significantly, and that class dynamics centered on work were no longer central to explain group formation and collective action among the popular sectors. While in countries like Argentina scholars have explained these processes by focusing on the effects of the de-industrialization of the economy and the informalization of the job market, in Chile analysts have done so by emphasizing the growth of the service sector and the emergence of a middle-class society where `old-fashioned' working-class identities have become irrelevant. This article questions these arguments based on a comparative analysis of the relationship between objective class position and subjective class identification in Argentina and Chile in 2009. The results show that class still matters. In both countries, people with a working-class position or a working-class trajectory are significantly more likely to uphold working-class identity than individuals with a privileged class position or trajectory. Surprisingly, the authors' analysis also demonstrates that the overall rates of working-class identification are higher in Chile than in Argentina. The authors explain these unexpected results by looking at contemporary class-related phenomena (e.g. higher inequality and economic concentration in Chile) and longer-term class dynamics (particularly differences stemming from the `radical' party\textendash union configuration in Chile and the state-corporatist incorporation of labor in Argentina).},

  abstract = {Exceptional cases are at odds with the typical: they stand out as bizarre and rare. What then could justify their systematic analysis? Elaborating the analytical distinction between anomalies, exceptions and outliers, this paper outlines three potential epistemic contributions of exceptional cases. First, exceptional cases reveal the limits of standard classification categories. In so doing, they problematize usual classificatory grids. Their input is critical. Second, exceptional cases point to new classes of objects. They acquire paradigmatic status when they exemplify the characteristic features of these new classes with utmost clarity. Third, exceptional cases magnify relational patterns that in more mundane contexts lack visibility. Here their contribution is heuristic. These three contributions become possible when we put at bay normative expectations of what should happen, and specify cases by reference to an analytical space of constitutive dimensions. To underscore the general significance of these observations, I draw on examples borrowed from different quarters of the social sciences: the sociology of organizations, ethnomethodology, comparative historical sociology and the history of science., Les cas exceptionnels apparaissent le plus souvent comme atypiques, bizarres ou rares. D\`es lors comment justifier d'en proposer une analyse syst\'ematique ? \`A partir d'une distinction analytique entre les anomalies, les exceptions et les d\'eviations, cet article met en avant trois contributions \'epist\'emiques des cas exceptionnels. Tout d'abord, les cas exceptionnels r\'ev\`elent les limites des cat\'egories et classifications standards. Ils permettent de probl\'ematiser les grilles classificatoires. Leur apport est critique. Ensuite, les cas exceptionnels permettent d'identifier de nouvelles classes d'objets. Ils acqui\`erent un statut paradigmatique lorsqu'ils manifestent les caract\'eristiques sp\'ecifiques de ces nouvelles classes. Enfin, les cas exceptionnels mettent en \'evidence des mod\`eles relationnels qui dans des contextes plus ordinaires resteraient invisibles. Leur contribution est ici heuristique. Ces trois contributions deviennent possibles lorsque nous suspendons nos attentes normatives par rapport \`a ce qui devrait se passer, et sp\'ecifions les cas en r\'ef\'erence \`a un espace analytique de dimensions constitutives. L'article s'appuie sur des exemples tir\'es principalement des sciences sociales : la sociologie des organisations, l'ethnom\'ethodologie, la sociologie historique comparative et l'histoire des sciences., Au\ss ergew\"ohnliche Situationen werden meist als untypisch, komisch und selten dargestellt. Womit l\"asst sich dann aber ihre systematische Untersuchung rechtfertigen? Ausgehend von der Differenzierung zwischen Abweichungen, Ausnahmen und Sonderf\"allen, hebt dieser Beitrag drei epistemische Beitr\"age au\ss ergew\"ohnlicher F\"alle hervor. Erstens verdeutlichen au\ss ergew\"ohnliche F\"alle die Grenzen von Kategorien und Klassifizierungen. Ihr Beitrag ist kritisch. Zweitens verweisen au\ss ergew\"ohnliche F\"alle auf neue Gegenstandsmodelle. Sie erhalten einen paradigmatischen Rang durch das Aufzeigen spezifischer Charakteristika dieser neuen Modelle. Drittens verdeutlichen au\ss ergew\"ohnliche F\"alle Beziehungsmodelle, die in gew\"ohnlicheren Zusammenh\"angen unsichtbar bleiben. Ihr Beitrag ist hier heuristisch. Diese drei Beitr\"age sind m\"oglich, wenn wir unsere normativen Verhaltensweisen bez\"uglich des Vorhersehbaren aufheben und die F\"alle in Beziehung zu einem analytischen Raum konstitutiver Dimensionen setzen.

  abstract = {ABSTRACT This article examines whether there is gender segmentation in civic participation in Latin America, and whether such segmentation is related to gender differences in political participation. Confirming the findings of other studies, this analysis indicates that there is gender segmentation in civic associational activities, and that men are more involved than women in political activities, except for voting. Among those involved in civic activities, however, women attend meetings more often than men or about equally in all types of activities under consideration, except for sports and recreational pursuits. This highlights the need to differentiate between type and intensity of civic participation and provides empirical evidence that Latin American women have strong community ties through a variety of organizations. The regression analysis shows that civic engagement has a positive effect on political participation but that the magnitude of that effect varies by gender depending on the activity.},

  abstract = {Argentina and Uruguay are the only democracies in Latin America (among few in the world) that have developed sustained, state-oriented national and sectoral wage bargaining between employers and unions after 2005. The article defines ``segmented neo-corporatism'' as a new form of centralized incomes policy in the region that applies to a substantial portion (i.e., registered workers), though not to all the labor force. Drawing on neo-corporatist theory, I explain, first, why only Argentina and Uruguay could consolidate a centralized, national wage policy in the context of the Latin American Left-Turn. Second, I test empirically the degree of state-oriented wage coordination. The study argues that monetary policy deterrence and higher levels of bargaining centralization largely explain the greater capacity of Uruguayan neo-corporatism to govern wage-setting compared with its Argentine counterpart. Finally, the article puts segmented neo-corporatism in comparative perspective in the developing world and draws some theoretical implications.},

Argentina has advanced further than Chile in two policy areas: corporate taxation, which taps firmlevel profits; and tax agency access to bank information, which helps reduce income tax evasion. These outcomes are explained by drawing on the classic concepts of business instrumental power, which entails political actions, and structural power, which arises from investment decisions. In Chile, strong instrumental power removed reforms in both areas from the policy agenda. In Argentina, much weaker instrumental power at the cross-sectoral level facilitated corporate tax increases. Bank information access was expanded after Argentina's 2001 crisis weakened the financial sector's instrumental power and reduced structural power.},

  abstract = {Structural power is a critical variable that merits more extensive and more explicit attention in Latin American political economy and in comparative politics more broadly. Assessing structural power in conjunction with its counterpart, instrumental power, can provide strong leverage for explaining variation in policy outcomes that affect business interests. However, structural power must be carefully defined and operationalized in order to capture its core attributes and nuances. This task requires wedding the concept's ``structural'' underpinnings with policymakers' perceptions and anticipated reactions. Moreover, the relationship between structural power and instrumental power must be carefully theorized. While these concepts encompass distinct channels through which business exerts influence, the two types of power may be mutually reinforcing. I argue that business interests shape policy outcomes when either their structural power or their instrumental power is strong, yet business influence will be more extensive and more consistent when structural power and instrumental power are both strong. However, electoral incentives, and more importantly, popular mobilization, can counteract business power. I illustrate these theoretical points with a case study of Chile's 2014 tax reform proposal, a major policy initiative with important distributive consequences that received international press attention.},

We focus on electoral competition for low-income voters in conjunction with the power of organized actors\textemdash both business and social movements. We argue that electoral competition motivates redistribution under left-wing and right-wing incumbents alike although such initiatives are more modest when conservatives dominate and business is well organized. Social mobilization drives more substantial redistribution by counterbalancing business power and focusing incumbents on securing social peace and surviving in office. By characterizing distinctive features of social-policy politics and tax-policy politics and theorizing linkages between the two realms, we contribute to broader debates on the relative influence of voters versus organized interests in policymaking. We apply our theory to explain ``least-likely'' cases of redistributive policies under conservative governments in Mexico (2000-2012) and Chile (2010-2014).},

Civil rights activists scored the highest on four measures of active conventional and unconventional politics. The noninvolved in college politics are the least active as adults.

Contrary to Marxist thought, evidence on the deskilling of working-class occupations is inconclusive. Marxist and non-Marxists agree that management has not succeeded in dictating the control of work. The literature fails to locate connections between technology, work alienation, job dissatisfaction, and the societal alienation of workers. Weakest theory and research deal with the political mobiliza of the working class, which is hampered by its internal stratification and cleavages. Paradoxically, labor unions are more effective in promoting consumer interests than those of their members or other workers.},

Dockworkers' strategic location in the economies of both countries would predict a high degree of shop-floor power among both groups. In practice, however, Colombian dock-workers had far less shop-floor power than their Chilean counterparts, as a result of mitigating social and political factors. Consequently, they developed a strategy this study terms human rights unionism, relying on external allies and lawsuits for leverage, rather than shop-floor action. Dockworkers in Chile, by contrast, adopted a strategy termed class struggle unionism, relying on nationally and internationally coordinated shop-floor action. This article therefore proposes an expanded model of workers' structural power, incorporating the roles of state and society to better account for power differentials and divergent strategic pathways among workers who share a common position in the economic system.},

This question is examined through a study of the International Dockworkers Council (IDC), an exceptional case of institutionalised rank-and-file union democracy at the transnational level. A shadow comparison examines the work of the International Transport Workers Federation, a bureaucratic trade union organisation active in the same sector. The IDC's structure is found to increase the efficacy of transnational unionism by removing layers of bureaucratic mediation that slow down action, fostering a culture of militant solidarity among participants. Nevertheless, participants noted the heavy personal burdens placed on activists under this model and some difficulties of operating without the assistance of paid professionals. Additionally, differing national legal and political contexts for unionism remain significant barriers to effective internationalism.},

  abstract = {As unions face an ongoing crisis all over the industrialized world, they have often been portrayed as outmoded remnants of an old economic structure. This book argues that despite structural shifts in the economy and in politics, unions retain important functions for capitalist economies as well as for political democracy. Union revitalization in the face of their current difficulties is therefore of fundamental importance. This book charts the strategies unions use to respond to global union decline and to revive their fortunes in five countries \textemdash{} the liberal market economies of the US and the UK; the coordinated economy of Germany and the Mediterranean economies of Italy and Spain \textemdash{} thus providing a wide range of institutional settings, union structures, identities, and union responses. Each chapter provides a comparative analysis of a particular strategy, looking in turn at union organizing, social partnership, political action, organizational restructuring, coalition-building, and international action. It provides a rich source of documentation about union activity, but more importantly it goes beyond description to address two of the big questions in comparative research: How can we explain cross-country differences in union responses to global decline? And how effective are these actions in helping to revitalize national labour movements?},

Labor market segmentation implies priviliges, and these, in turn, provide for class alliances aimed at perpetuating segmentation. Here the crucial class division within the labor market is seen as located along the manual-nonmanual occupational divide. The concepts of equalizing pay differentials, noncompeting groups, and barriers to education are used to show that the nonmanual working class has a strong incentive to form alliance with capital, at least as long as benefits which might derive from different alliances remain unspecified. pg 259-285},

It focuses on three types of consequences: political, personal and biographical, and cultural. Political consequences and, in particular, policy outcomes receive most attention, as they are those which have been addresses most often by students of social movements. The review of existing work shows that the field is full of valuable works dealing with this crucial issue and is rapidly growing thanks in particular to a new wave of scholars interested in this topic. Further work should pay more attention to the unintended consequences of social movements, look also at other types of impacts, and carry more comparative analyses.},

Specifically, the association is stronger among workers reporting excessive pressures, and weaker among those with decision-making latitude and some schedule control.},

The second contends that, institutional conditions permitting, unions' coordination of bargaining strategies is sufficient. Coordination is most likely to be achieved when there are small number of unions that do not compete for members, that is, when union monopoly is high. Important empirical anomalies may be resolved by analyzing the effects of union centralization and monopoly separately, rather than combining them into a composite index of corporatism. Reanalyzing comparative data from Organization of Economic Cooperation and Development countries between 1963 and 1985 largely corroborates the hypothesis that monopoly is more important than either centralization or composite indices of corporatism for national economic performance. The conceptual rationale underlying indices of corporatism should be reexamined.},

  abstract = {Ten years ago, when the volume Order and Conflict in Contemporary Capitalism (Goldthorpe 1984) was published, conventional academic wisdom regarding the future of trade unions and corporatism in western Europe was optimistic. As numerous contributors to that earlier volume emphasized, systems of industrial relations involving encompassing unions, in which authority was concentrated in either a small number of large industrial unions or in national confederations, had performed remarkably well in the decade after the first oil price shock of 1973. Most contributors to the Goldthorpe volume shared the view articulated by Peter Lange (1984) that unions could be thought of as playing an n-person prisoner's dilemma in which decentralized action among organizations resulted in collectively suboptimal outcomes. Unions would accept greater wage restraint collectively, the argument went, but not willingly concede acting individually. The prisoner's dilemma analogy suggested that the more encompassing the union movement, the greater the concentration among unions, and the more centralized the authority of the peak associations, the more likely it was that the collectively optimal cooperative solution could be obtained. David Cameron (1984), among others, provided support for this view with evidence showing that corporatism was associated with wage restraint and low strike rates, as well as with lower inflation and less unemployment than in noncorporatist OECD countries.},

When local solidarities are ignored, the weakness of conventional aggregate models is easily misinterpreted as evidence of generic destructuration, and standard postmodernist formulations are accordingly difficult to resist. Although local structuration is often regarded as sociologically trivial, the available evidence suggests that such class analytic processes as closure, exploitation, and collective action emerge more clearly at the level of disaggregate occupations than conventional aggregate classes.},

  abstract = {Scholars interested in labour in Latin America have traditionally paid little attention to trade unions' legal mobilisation. However, the increasing number of legal complaints filed by workers with labour ministries and/or the courts in countries like Argentina, Brazil and Chile calls for a more serious debate on the role that trade unions play in this process. This article focuses on the Chilean case. Drawing on various sources, it shows that Chilean unions have turned legal complaints into a weapon to gain more rights and curb employers' power. This process has involved the strongest and most combative unions, and is due to two historical conditions: (1) the obstacles placed in the way of successful resort to more disruptive tactics; (2) the increase in institutional opportunities to report infringements of the law. Overall, the article challenges the current image of the Chilean unions by foregrounding their agency and their achievements over the last decade.},

Labor reform served simultaneously to consolidate political democracy and slow down the momentum of social democratization. It was a tool for signalling policy change to legitimate the democratic regime, but at the same time leaving the liberal economy intact. The Chilean case calls into question the thesis of a natural progression from political to social rights prevalent in democratic theory, and allows us to generalize about the way marketization places limits on democratic deepening. The article first discusses what would be appropriate criteria of social democratization considering contemporary labor issues and labor relations in Chile. It then investigates the political process of labor reform. Ongoing legal debates through the 1990s show the extent of path dependence set in motion by the timid nature of the first social reforms in Chile's new demoncracy and their muting effect on citizenship.},

Using the WERS2004 linked employer\textendash employee data and alternative econometric estimators it reports an inverse relationship between workplace union density and gender diversity. Gender and ownership status based sub-group analyses suggest the inverse relationship to be stronger for male union members and those in the private sector. Gender group size-based analysis reveals a positive link between workplace union density and gender diversity in workplaces with a female majority. The findings in this paper may mean that unions may need to embrace the changing workplace demography genuinely to improve their fate.},

Comparing regions with such different social, economic, and political systems contributes to our understanding of variation in beliefs about women's opportunity systems. Using a conceptual framework that connects socio-political systems, gender, and attitudes about opportunity, we hypothesize that Eastern Europeans' unique experiences (especially their experiences with communism and post-communism) will result in a very different set of ideas about opportunities for getting ahead than is the case for Western Europeans. We also hypothesize that given the potency of gender in structuring opportunities, the attitudes of women in these regions will be distinct from those of men and that the gender differences will not be the same in Eastern and Western Europe. Our findings provide support for these hypotheses. The East vs. West variable has a significant impact on a majority of the attitude measures. Results show a greater emphasis among East Europeans on the importance of non-individual, structural factors for getting ahead. Gender is also important in affecting attitudes about opportunity but its effect varies across region and across time. Implications for research on mobility systems are discussed.},

Specifically, the project seeks to explore the role of `empowering' forms of work organisation (in particular Total Quality Management, team-based work and consultative committees) and of occupational hierarchies, respectively, in influencing levels of employee autonomy. Data from the 1995 Australian Workplace Industrial Relations Survey (AWIRS95) are used to construct quantitative indicators of `empowering' forms of work organisation, hierarchy and employee autonomy. Associations between the variables are measured. The analysis shows no association between `empowerment' and employee autonomy. There are, however, clear relationships between employees' positions within occupational hierarchies and their levels of control over their work. Therefore, the empowerment thesis is rejected. A provisional explanation for the failure of empowerment to enhance employee autonomy can be found in the fact that organisational power resides primarily in organisational structures. Contrary to claims of the emergence of the `post-bureaucratic organisation', hierarchical structures remain central to the majority of contemporary organisations, and the impact of other changes to work organisation must be understood in this context.},

But what ought to count here is not only how society is structured but why it is structured in certain ways and this means grappling with the dynamics of the structure\textemdash agency dialectic. Dowding overestimates the degree to which business is systematically lucky and underestimates the degree to which it is powerful because he fails to recognise the way in which business can shape the structures whose existence allows it to get what it wants without trying. We examine the position of two very different groups: British farmers and US bankers. British farmers were systematically lucky in the post-war years in the sense that they benefited from events outside their control. The US banking sector was lucky in 2008 because it was `too big to fail'. But the banks had previously used their power to shape this outcome.},

Political battles over trade policy appear to have sometimes divided societies along broad class lines and at other times split them into narrow industry-based coalitions. I argue that this diversity stems from historical and cross-national variation in inter-industry factor mobility. Class coalitions are more likely where factor mobility is high, whereas narrow, industry-based coalitions are more likely where mobility is low. Evidence from six Western economies for the last two centuries indicates that levels of factor mobility have varied historically and cross-nationally in accord with industrialization and regulation. This variation corresponds broadly with observable differences in the formation of trade policy coalitions.},

Very little research has addressed the equally important questions of strike outcomes and trade union membership despite the substantial body of research on the causes of trade union membership decline and strategies for membership growth. In this paper we reverse the usual sequence of trade union membership as a causal factor in the genesis of strikes and examine the impact of strikes on trade union membership levels. After setting out the relevant theory and hypotheses, we use a unique seven-year dataset of trade union membership joiners and leavers from a major British trade union with a substantial record of strike activity. Controlling for other possible determinants of trade union membership, we find that months in which there is strike action, whether national or local, are associated with a significantly higher rate of membership growth, measured both by the number of joiners and by the ratio of joiners to leavers. Data from new union members suggest that perceived injustice and perceived union effectiveness both motivate the decision to join.},

I argue that theoretical and empirical challenges often misread Bourdieu, recasting the theory as a variant of Lloyd Warner's social class theory. I use this evaluation to reformulate the theory to reflect socio-historical circumstances particular to the contemporary United States. In an interpretive study of cultural capital and patterns of taste motivated by this reformulation, briefly summarized here, I find six dimensions of taste that vary across cultural capital resources. Finally, I consider the implications of this interpretation of Bourdieu's theory for survey research concerned with patterns of taste and social reproduction.},

  year = {1999},
  publisher = {{Cambridge University Press}},
  address = {{Cambridge}},
  abstract = {This book explores the political and economic couplings between wage bargaining institutions, macro-economic policy regimes, and the welfare state. Based on a game-theoretic equilibrium model, the first part of the study argues that macro-economic performance (especially unemployment) is the outcome of an interaction between the centralization of the wage bargaining system and the character of the monetary policy regime. Thus, in semi-decentralized (industry-based) bargaining systems where the government is credibly committed to a non-accommodating monetary policy rule, strategic foresight dictates that unions and employers observe price-wage restraint compatible with low unemployment. In highly centralized bargaining systems, by contrast, monetary policy flexibility facilitates distributive compromises among unions, and leads to restrained price-wage behavior. Only in decentralized bargaining systems is money is neutral in the sense that policies have no real economic effects. When institutions are mal-aligned \textendash{} centralization coupled with a non-accommodating regime, or semi-decentralization coupled with a flexible regime \textendash{} distributive conflicts and price-wage militancy result in poor economic performance. The argument is supported by econometric evidence from 15 organized market economies over a 21-year period. Pareto-superior institutions are collectively preferred by governments and organized interests, but these institutions are politically contested because the particular institutional setup affects the balance of power between different interests and leads to divergent distributional outcomes in terms of wages, unemployment risks, and welfare benefits. The second part of the study is an analysis of this political contest over institutional design. Modeled as a strategic game between the government and cross-class coalitions of unions and employers, changes in the economic, technological, and political environment alter the balance of power and lead to sectoral realignments and institutional reforms. Specifically, the recent trends away from centralized wage bargaining and full employment policies in highly corporatist countries such as Denmark and Sweden are explained as the outcome of cross-class realignments between strategically located unions and employers triggered by the introduction of new production technologies, economic internationalization, and the fiscal crisis of the state. Aimed at increasing wage flexibility, while simultaneously containing cost pressure, the resulting institutional reforms have been associated with greater wage inequality and a re-orientation of government policies toward the pursuit of low inflation and a more "commodified" system of welfare benefits.},

  abstract = {INTRODUCTIONSocial movements have traditionally been defined as organized efforts to bring about social change (cf. Jenkins, 1983; McAdam and Snow, 1997:xviii\textendash xxv; McCarthy and Zald, 1977:1217\textendash 18; Tarrow, 1998:4\textendash 6; Wilson, 1973:3\textendash 4). Yet, as several scholars have noted (Burstein, Einwohner, and Hollander, 1995; Giugni, 1998, 1999; Huberts, 1989; Lofland, 1993:347\textendash 8), whether and how they actually cause social change has received little attention. Social movement research has long focused on questions of emergence and participation. Some attention has been paid to immediate social movements outcomes but scant attention has focused of social movement change. By the latter, we mean the distinctive contribution of social movements to change net of ongoing changes and social processes. Many studies have examined the short-term or immediate outcomes of movements, for example, life course change (Fendrich, 1993; McAdam, 1988), policy enactment (Burstein, 1985; Burstein and Freudenberg, 1978; Costain, 1992), and policy implementation (Button, 1989; Handler, 1978), but few have placed these processes in a multivariate framework and controlled for the relevant societal influences. Most studies of movements have focused inward and have been ``movement-centered'' (Lofland, 1993:289\textendash 91), thus neglecting their possible impact on social change in the broader society. When movement outcomes have been studied, they have typically focused on immediate public policy effects and not the broader institutional and cultural changes central to long-term movement objectives. Understanding social movement change is central to political sociology because the field is defined as the study of social power (see chapter 1). Similarly, social movements are defined as organized efforts to bring about social changes in the distribution of power.},

Todo ello dentro de un contexto de hip\'otesis sobre la invarianza de las pautas de movilidad en las sociedades industriales -o en proceso de industrializaci\'on- y de hip\'otesis de existencia de "cierres" en los niveles altos y/o de "zonas de amortiguamiento" en los niveles medios de la estructura ocupacional o de clase. Aunando enfoques te\'oricos predominantes y razones pragm\'aticas, cuatro categor\'ias ocupacionales o de clase son usadas (alto y bajo no manual y manual). Modelos de movilidad perfecta y casi-perfecta no ajustan los datos, surgiendo un buen ajuste de un modelo de las esquinas acotado a la esquina no manual en Capital, a la manual en el Area Metropolitana. As\'i, despu\'es de eliminar la inmovilidad de la heredad ocupacional (diagonal principal) y de los "excesos" de movimientos dentro del estrato no manual (Capital), o del manual (Area Metropolitana) -casos donde todav\'ia se dar\'ia la influencia de los padres- se observa movilidad perfecta en el resto del cuadro. Las rigideces habr\'ian cambiado del estrato manual al no manual en los trece a\~nos que van de 1969 a 1982. Los hallazgos tienden a cuestionar las tesis sobre "cierre" o sobre "zonas de amortiguamiento" y a apoyar hip\'otesis sobre invarianza de las pautas de movilidad. /// An intergenerational male occupational mobility table of Buenos Aires City (1982) is analized, and comparisons with a similar one from the Buenos Aires Metropolitan Area (1969) are introduced. Discussions take place within a context of hypotheses on the invariance of mobility patterns in industrial or industrializing societies, and of hypotheses on the existence of "closure" in the higher levels and/or "buffer-zones" in the middle levels of the occupational or class structure. On the basis of theoretical and pragmatic concerns, four occupational or class categories are used (high and low non manual and manual). Models of perfect and quasi-perfect mobility do not fit the data, so a version of the corners model is considered and it achieves an acceptable fit. If immobility due to occupational inheritance (main diagonal) is excluded and the "excess" short-distance mobility in the nonmanual stratum (Buenos Aires City), or the "excess" short-distance mobility in the manual stratum (Metropolitan Area) are also excluded -situations where father influences still persist-, perfect mobility is observed in the rest of each table. Rigidity found in the manual stratum of 1969 would be present in the nonmanual stratum thirteen years later. Findings tend to question hypotheses on the existence of "closure" or of a "buffer-zone", and to lend support to hypotheses on the invariance of mobility patterns.},

  abstract = {Two quite different approaches to the problem of class formation were examined. Implicit in the first, used primarily by social historians, is the notion that the presence or absence of a predisposition to radicalism is the main determinant of organized working-class behavior. Here, class formation involves the development of revolutionary class consciousness. The second, used primarily by political scientists, employs deductive models to analyze class formation as a routine problem in collective organization. By placing the insights provided by the social history perspective into a rational choice framework, the existence of contrasting modes of class formation is hypothesized. Differences in labor militancy serve as the key intervening variable between more particularistic and more universalistic labor movements. Nineteenth- and twentieth-century aggregate cross-sectional data from 14 capitalist democracies is used to examine the relationship between contemporary labor militancy and particular historical structural conditions. Distinct modes of class formation are the product of specific structural characteristics. Labor movement particularism, as represented by higher strike rates in recent years, is strongest where the lag between democratization and industrialization is minimal and industrialization commenced relatively early,, while greater time between democratization and industrialization and late industrialization are associated with low militancy and solidaristic labor movements.},

  abstract = {One of the most familiar theories about politics in Australia, as in Britain, is that the political parties are divided fundamentally on class lines. But the strength and nature of the link between class and party remains both controversial and unclear. This paper brings new evidence to bear by applying powerful multivariate techniques to national sample survey data from Australia, Britain and the USA. We distinguish three separate aspects of class: the categorical distinction between blue- and white-collar workers which informs the standard definition of class in political science; an occupational status aspect which ranks jobs on a continuum running from low to high; and conflict aspects, based on 'ownership of the means of production', on the 'exercise of authority in the workplace', and the cleavage between public and private employees. We show, first, that these quite distinct aspects of class have different effects. In Australia occupational status has important effects on income and class self-image but is politically irrelevant. The much maligned blue-collar/white-collar distinction is, indeed, financially irrelevant but, none the less, has appreciable effects on class self-image and political preferences, while the conflict aspects have modest but clear effects on income, class self-image and politics. Whether or not an individual is a public employee is consistently important in all three countries. Second, the impact of class on party is relatively modest, albeit cler. Finally, these patterns are quite similar in Australia, Britain and the USA.},

Design/methodology/approach \textendash{} Review of theoretical and empirical literature, including comparative literature. Findings \textendash{} Both strike activity and other forms of collective action have declined in many advanced capitalist countries. There has been a rise in the number of strike ballots and in tribunal claims but these trends do not constitute a straightforward vindication of the displacement hypothesis. However there is evidence of an increase in general strikes in parts of Western Europe and of protest campaigns involving coalitions of unions and civil society organizations. Originality/value \textendash{} The paper tries to summarize the current state of knowledge and to map out directions for future research.},

In addition, some scholars are rather skeptical about the validity and/or reliability of these measures. This article offers a survey and assessment of fifteen wage-setting measures. It attempts to answer questions about (1) how these indicators differ from one another in conceptualization and measurement strategy; (2) which are the most valid and reliable; (3) the strengths and weaknesses of measures of wage centralization versus those of wage coordination; (4) particular countries or time periods for which there are noteworthy discrepancies in scoring; (5) how sensitive empirical findings are to the choice of wage-setting measure.},

Statistical analyses find that union membership is associated with many forms of political activity, including voting, protesting, association membership, and others. Union effects are larger for less educated individuals, a group that otherwise exhibits low levels of participation. Union membership is not associated with outcomes distant from union political agendas, such as general volunteering and charitable giving, suggesting that unions generate political capital rather than generalized social capital.},

Although worker organization is central to explaining income inequality in industrialized democracies, worldwide comparative studies have neglected the role of class-based actors. I argue that the repression of labor rights reduces the capacity of worker organizations to effectively challenge income inequality through market and political processes in capitalist societies. Labor rights, however, are unlikely to have uniform effects across regions. This study uses unbalanced panel data for 100 developed and less developed countries from 1985 through 2002. Random- and fixed-effects models find that strong labor rights are tightly linked to lower inequality across a large range of countries, including in the Global South. Interactions between regions and labor rights suggest that the broader context in which class-based actors are embedded shapes worker organizations' ability to reduce inequality. During the period of this study, labor rights were particularly important for mitigating inequality in the West but less so in Eastern Europe.},

We argue that national political institutions\textemdash specifically, democracy and corporatism\textemdash shape the ways that unions mobilize their members to engage in the political sphere. Democratic regimes provide structural opportunities and cultural repertoires that lead unions to focus on member mobilization, especially via contentious politics and political parties. Corporatism, which directly links unions to state structures, undercuts the logics and incentives for union mobilization. We draw upon historical cases of Germany, the United States, Chile, and Egypt to illustrate how democracy and corporatism shape unions' mobilization efforts. Multilevel models of World Values Survey data from roughly 60 countries find that union members participate more than non-members across a range of electoral and extra-institutional political acts, such as demonstrating, occupying buildings, signing petitions, party work, and so forth. In democratic societies, such effects are stronger and participation shifts toward parties and contentious politics. In less democratic societies, union members are particularly likely to work with and through other political organizations. Corporatist arrangements generally dampen the political activities of union members.},

A recent study shows that collective protest by organized labor effectively increases social security and welfare spending, whereas mass protest does not have comparable effects on human capital spending in Latin American democracies. This article reexamines the analysis and demonstrates that organized labor alone cannot sway democratic governments. Labor strikes require the synchronizing effect of mass protest to obtain government concessions. Only through concurrent episodes of mass protest can organized labor overcome the numerical disadvantage of pressing democratic government for social welfare spending. In understanding the relationship between labor protests and social welfare spending through the lens of insider-outsider dichotomy, it is critical to consider the synchronizing effect of mass protests. The findings remain robust with alternative measures of democracy and various model specifications.},

  abstract = {Why do some protest movements in Latin America succeed in rolling back privatizations while others fail? This article argues that protests against privatizations have tended to succeed under two conditions. First, privatization's opponents form linkages (or ``brokerage'') across multiple sectors of society. Broad coalitions are more likely to achieve their goals, while groups acting alone, such as labor unions, are more easily defeated or ignored by governments. Second, civil rights are protected but political representation is weak. In that case, opponents have the legal right to protest, but are unlikely to have opportunities for communicating their concerns through formal institutions, which prompts them to channel their demands outside of existing political institutions. Using case examples and logistic regression, this study confirms these arguments and discusses the implications for democracy in the region.},

  abstract = {Union density remains very high in Sweden. The significantly raised fees for union unemployment funds in January 2007 were followed by an unprecedented decline in the number of union members in modern Swedish history. In the course of two years union density dropped by 6 percentage points: from 77\% in 2006 to 71\% in 2008. As a result, the density of employers' associations today is much higher than union density. The article below describes and analyzes union decline among different groups of workers and why it was not difficult to foresee this development when the center-right government sharply raised membership contributions to finance the state-subsidized Swedish unemployment insurance. From July 2008 the government more closely linked fund fees to the unemployment rate for each fund, thus differentiating fund fees between different groups of employees. Since the subsequent economic crisis hit private sector blue-collar workers harder than other employees, the differentiation of fees was further widened. As a consequence, total union fees (including fund fees) also varied more by time and between different categories of workers, which in turn was reflected in the development of union density. From 2006 to 2010 blue-collar density fell by 8 percentage points compared to the 4-point decline among white-collar workers. In contrast to the depression of the 1990s, union density did not increase when unemployment increased rapidly from 2008 to 2009. The article also discusses why the government failed to achieve its main goal of changing the financing system of unemployment insurance: to influence wage formation.},

  abstract = {Purpose The purpose of this paper is to reconstruct the development of industrial relations (IR) in Spain since the democratic transition and analyses the current dilemmas of its social and political actors in the context of the long-lasting economic downturn. Design/methodology/approach Combining a political economy, identifying Spain as a particular variety of modern capitalism, and actor-centred historical institutionalism approach, outlining the formation and strategies of the main social actors, the paper draws on the broad range of research on IR in Spain and its theoretical debates, including proper research in the field. Findings The legacies of the latecomer industrialisation and the semi-peripheral development model still shape the Spanish economy and IR. The impact of the current economic and political-institutional crisis affects the entire institutional IR system and its actors shifting power towards the individual employer thus weakening trade unions, labour rights and collective bargaining. Regarding the theoretical debate on corporatism, the Spanish case provides ambiguous results. The lack of a coherent institutional system and efficient political administration limits the effectiveness of corporatist arrangements and reduces them to contingent concertation strategies. Spain confirms that IR still largely depend on the specific national variety of capitalism that condition economic development and resources for political exchange. Originality/value The paper presents an original, theoretical-informed reconstruction of the Spanish IR and allows an understanding of the current institutional transformations and strategic dilemmas in the light of historical legacies. Additionally, the theoretical debates on neo-corporatism and semi-peripheral development are enriched through its application to the Spanish case.},

Contrary to the prediction of the semiproletarianization thesis, dependent capitalist development in South Korea has been accompanied by a swifter, more abrupt, and more intense proletarianization than occurred in 19th and 20th century Europe. The compressed process involves a simultaneous increase in blue-collar and white-collar workers and a rapid feminization of white-collar occupations. Korean workers have not made strong collective responses to proletarianization, largely because of repressive state control of the labor movement and the absence of a strong artisan cultural tradition. But rapid proletarianization has facilitated development of the working-class movement. The specific pattern of Korean industrial transformation and workers' reactions to it have been shaped more strongly by the developmental role of the state than the autonomous activities of capital.},

The "new politics " perspective holds that in the present era of austerity, class-based parties once driving welfare state expansion have been superseded by powerful new interest groups of welfare-state clients capable of largely resisting retrenchment pressures emanating from postindustrial forces. We argue that retrenchment can fruitfully be analyzed as distributive conflict involving a remaking of the early postwar social contract based on the full employment welfare state, a conflict in which partisan politics and welfare-state institutions are likely to matter. Pointing to problems of conceptualization and measurement of the dependent variable in previous research, we bring in new data on the extent of retrenchment in social citizenship rights and show that the long increase in social rights has been turned into a decline and that significant retrenchment has taken place in several countries. Our analyses demonstrate that partisan politics remains significant for retrenchment also when we take account of contextual indictors, such as constitutional veto points, economic factors, and globalization.},

The main hypothesis is that there are contradictory movements. On the one hand, there has been real improvement of various labor market indicators, especially regarding the formalization, falling unemployment and increased of the workers real income. On the other hand, the process of liberalization of labor relations persists, as in the case of outsourcing, the variable compensation and the control of labor day length. It is from that perspective that we discuss the evolution of the labor market in that time period as well as the trends of public regulation of labor via state and via collective bargaining and the role of certain public institutions},

  abstract = {This article uses a classical Marxist framework to study the consciousness and action of inside postal workers in Hamilton, Ontario during and after their participation in the 1987 strike by the Canadian Union of Postal Workers (CUPW). At the time of the strike the Hamilton Local of CUPW was 58 per cent women; the article includes a discussion of the impact of gender processes on women worker's consciousness and action. It also deals with three more general issues. First, through a discussion of conceptual issues and the presentation of a multi-level theoretical model, I offer advice on how to proceed with empirical research on strikes and class consciousness. Second, the "culture of solidarity" portrayal of strikers, as developed by Rick Fantasia, is criticized for presenting an over-integrated view of the participation and consciousness of strikers. I argue that one need not romanticize striking workers in order to be optimistic about the political role of the contemporary working class. This optimism must recognize that in a macro context of politico-economic stability, only a minority of a striking workforce can be expected to experience an expansion of generalized class consciousness. Third, I suggest that Marxist political action in the 1990s should concentrate on the development of generalized class consciousness, especially workers' positive sense of class unity, through the organization of local worker solidarity networks. /// Cet article propose une analyse marxiste classique de la relation entre conscience et action chez les postiers de la ville de Hamilton, Ontario, pendant et apr\&\#xe8;s la gr\&\#xe8;ve men\&\#xe9;e par le Syndicat des postiers du Canada (SPC) en 1987. Comme la section locale d'Hamilton \&\#xe9;tait compos\&\#xe9;e \&\#xe0; 58 pour cent de femmes au moment de la gr\&\#xe8;ve, l'article analyse l'impact du genre sur la conscience et l'action des posti\&\#xe8;res. Il traite aussi de trois autres questions g\&\#xe9;n\&\#xe9;rales. D'abord, je formule des suggestions quant \&\#xe0; la proc\&\#xe9;dure pour r\&\#xe9;aliser une recherche empirique sur les gr\&\#xe8;ves et la conscience de classe, en pr\&\#xe9;sentant diverses consid\&\#xe9;rations conceptuelles et un mod\&\#xe8;le th\&\#xe9;orique \&\#xe0; multiples niveaux. Dans un deuxi\&\#xe8;me temps, je critique la description des gr\&\#xe9;vistes qui fait appel \&\#xe0; la notion de "culture de la solidarit\&\#xe9;" avanc\&\#xe9;e par Rick Fantasia car elle con\&\#xe7;oit, \&\#xe0; mon sens, la participation et la conscience des gr\&\#xe9;vistes de mani\&\#xe8;re inappropri\&\#xe9;e.

This association is typically taken as prima facie evidence of economic self-interest: Classes hold different attitudes, values, and party preferences because they have different economic interests. However, this assumption has rarely been tested empirically. In this article, we use survey data from 18 West European countries to examine why classes differ on a central aspect of political preferences, namely their views on the desirability of income inequality. We find that only a moderate proportion of differences between employee classes in support for redistribution can be accounted for by contemporary differences in resources and risks; differences in economic interests to some degree account for the anti-redistributive preferences of the professional middle classes compared with the working class. However, the preferences of the self-employed have a different explanation; autonomy is a better explanation of the right-wing preferences of the self-employed compared with the working class.},

In such jobs, employers frequently try to manage the emotions of their workers, while workers try to control the emotional responses of service recipients. Management techniques for directing and monitoring interactive service workers extend managerial control to aspects of workers' selves usually considered outside of the scope of employer intervention. Bureaucratic controls are also extended beyond the boundaries of the organization through the management of customer behavior. While workers and consumers derive some benefits from the routinization of service interactions, its instrumental approach to human personality and social interaction raises troubling moral issues.},

The analysis demonstrates that, despite differences in gross mobility between Wright's and Goldthorpe's class schemes, the within-nation fluidity patterns do not differ by class scheme for these three countries. The results based on Wright's and Goldthorpe's class frameworks lead to essentially the same conclusion about across-country differences or similarities in fluidity patterns. The results based on Wright's framework are informative of expected country differences in class impermeability as structured by the three dimensions of property, skill, and authority, whereas those based on Goldthorpe's reveal cross-country variations in barriers as structured by economic and occupational sectors.},

Drawing on 18 months of extensive fieldwork conducted at several mining sites in Chile, the article contends that the analysis of precarious workers' organisations needs to consider workers' access to different organisational resources, and the role that political parties' militants play in such access, particularly in the Global South.},

In contrast to much of the treatment accorded such people in the popular media, this research tends to find most of these activists currently liberal on a wide variety of political topics. However, in the absence of panel data, most of this research has had to assess any change in the activists' attitudes either by assuming the activists' past positions or by trusting to their retrospective reports.In this paper we report on panel data from a large group of white activists, mostly students, who spent the summer of 1965 organizing voter registration drives in Southern black communities. In some specific areas on which the activists tended to hold rather extreme positions in 1965, they may have moderated by 1984. However, their overall pattern of response on a wide variety of issues is basically stable over this twenty-year period.},

Recent research, however, argues that previous empirical analyses of this relationship cannot be used to draw causal inferences. This recent work strongly suggests that selection mechanisms confound previous results, and it employs propensity score matching to argue that education has no effect. In this article I show how propensity score matching, as recently applied to this question, introduces bias by creating poorly matched treatment and control groups. I analyze the same data, realigning the treatment with theories of political participation, and I use genetic matching to create balanced treatment and control groups. I then subject the results to a variety of tests, providing a stronger foundation for causal inference. The estimates provide consistent evidence that, contrary to recent results, educational advancement increases political participation.},

Using both descriptive and inferential statistics, the author demonstrates a strong effect of participation on the subsequent lives of the volunteers and "no-shows." The volunteers were more politically active throughout the sixties than the no-shows and remain so today. In addition, the volunteers are much less likely to be married and to have significantly lower incomes at present than are the no-shows. Besides reporting these basic findings, the author seeks through path analysis to explore the specific factors and processes that mediate the impact of participation in Freedom Summer on the later lives of the volunteers.},

Workplace and legal studies suggest an expanded use of profiling and significant legal/professional implications for HRM practitioners, yet scant attention has been afforded to the boundaries of such practices. In this study, profiling is framed as a terrain on which employees and employers assert asymmetrical interests. Using survey data from large samples in Australia and the UK, the study investigates the prevalence and outcomes of profiling; the extent to which employees assert a right to privacy versus employer rights to engage in profiling; the extent to which organisations codify profiling practices; and employee responses in protecting online information. The findings contribute to a small and emerging body of evidence addressing how social media conduct at work is reconstituting and reshaping the boundaries between public and private spheres.},

Despite policy convergence, sectoral policies, which concentrate their effects on core supporters but are not salient for the median voter, could still be used to demonstrate partisan policymaking. Labor-linked parties used labor market regulation to keep labor supporters when facing political uncertainty despite regional convergence toward labor market deregulation. Incumbent labor-linked parties used labor reforms to keep labor allies because their effects were concentrated on formal workers who were already organized and had previous partisan alliances but did not change the preferences of the median voter.},

The authors answer the question by exploring the relationship between trade unions and two of their most important allies: labor-backed parties at home and labor rights activists overseas. While labor-backed parties in Latin America have locked in the support of their core constituencies by adopting relatively union-friendly labor laws in an otherwise uncertain political and economic environment, labor rights activists in the United States have demonstrated their support for their Latin American allies by asking the U.S. government to treat the protection of labor rights as the price of access to the U.S. market. The former trajectory is the norm in traditionally labor-mobilizing polities, where industrialization encouraged the growth of labor-backed parties in the postwar era; the latter is more common in more labor-repressive environments, where vulnerable unions tend to look for allies overseas.},

We examined this controversy using a variant of clique detection methods for business Political Action Committee (PAC) contributions to Congressional candidates in the 1980 election. One large group of corporations emerged based on shared conservative beliefs. No other groups nearly as large were detected. The findings were strong and robust for different levels of political similarity. The identified groups differed from each other economically in various ways, but these differences were not nearly as marked as the political differences. Overall, the evidence lends stronger support to the class rather than the pluralist perspective.},

It innovates on previous work on Latin American social policy by particularly examining the effect of unions and other civil society groups on the process of structural reforms (or lack thereof) in the health and pension sectors in Argentina and Brazil. Through a most similar system design, this analysis shows that the strength and support (or opposition) of organized civil society groups is a crucial condition to account for the enactment (or failure) of a given broad policy reform.},

  abstract = {For decades, analysts believed that the expansion of the service sector would lead to a `middle-class' society. By the late 20th century, class analysts and labour process scholars called into question this argument. They showed that distinctions such as that between `white-collar' and `blue-collar' work failed to capture the dynamics of control and exploitation within production. Nevertheless, in Chile and other parts of Latin America, research still contends that the expansion of employment in private-sector service activities accelerated the consolidation of a `new middle class'. This article challenges this idea. Drawing upon insights from neo-Marxist class analysis and labour process theory, the article compares the perceptions of control over the labour process of workers from different industries, employment sectors and class locations. Quantitative and qualitative evidence suggest that the most important conclusions of recent research are misleading.},

It is not just that fashions change, which they surely do, but beyond such ephemeral changes, the whole intellectual basis on which status markers are established shifts over time, harbingers of changing power relationships in society. This article shows the dynamics of such changes in the United States by tracing the rise and fall of highbrow snobbery as the standard of status honor over the last hundred years, and by setting this system in the context of the systems of status honor which preceded it and the system of cosmopolitan omnivorousness that has followed.},

Over the period 1975\textendash 95, countries that experienced relatively large declines in union density also experienced relatively large increases in earnings inequality. In addition, governments apparently became less willing to engage in `compensatory redistribution' in these countries. Since the early 1990s, however, union decline has become less closely associated with rising earnings inequality and redistributive policy changes. I argue that the declining relevance of unionization has to do with changes in the position of union members in the income distribution. In most OECD countries, the average union member has become relatively better off as union density has declined and union members have probably become less supportive of wage solidarity and redistributive government policies.},

  abstract = {In an exploratory study of matched samples in England and the United States, we construct a path model that explains 26\% and 39\%, respectively, of the variance in social judgments about the fairness or unfairness of equality. The underdog principle, from which we predict that egalitarians compared to inegalitarians are more likely to be nonwhite, to have low prestige occupations, to have low family incomes, and to identify with the lower and working classes, is accepted. The principle of enlightenment, from which we predict a positive relationship between education and favorable attitudes toward equality, is accepted for England but not for the United States. The principle of an egalitarian Zeitgeist, from which we predict younger people are more egalitarian than older people, is accepted for the United States but not for England. Two additional important causal variables are found. First, a sense of personal equity, that is, a belief that a person has the standard of living that he/she deserves, reduces egalitarian attitudes in England more than in the United States and may reflect a cultural belief that British society is extraordinarily just because social arrangements result from fair rules of the game. While it is of no importance in England, the cultural belief in monetary success reduces egalitarian attitudes in the United States and functions as the belief in the just society does in England.},

The spread of TNCs, the sharp increase in foreign direct investment, the proliferation of mergers and acquisitions across national borders, the rise of a global financial system, and the increased interlocking of positions within the global corporate structure, are some empirical indicators of the transnational integration of capitalists. The TCC manages global rather than national circuits of accumulation. This gives it an objective class existence and identity spatially and politically in the global system above any local territories and polities. The TCC became politicized from the 1970s into the 1990s and has pursued a class project of capitalist globalization institutionalized in an emergent transnational state apparatus and in a "Third Way" political program. The emergent global capitalist historic bloc is divided over strategic issues of class rule and how to achieve regulatory order in the global economy. Contradictions within the ruling bloc open up new opportunities for emancipatory projects from global labor.},

  abstract = {Abstract Social class has traditionally played a key role in explaining social behaviour and cognition. However, recent analyses have been dominated by the view that the relevance of class for behaviour has dwindled in advanced industrial societies. We contest this view by focusing on the subjective components of class consciousness. Using a national survey of Danish citizens, we show that individuals continue to hold meaningful conceptions of classes, to identify with them and, moreover, to perceive substantial levels of differences between them with these latter beliefs being strongly structured by respondent class identification. These results are all the more intriguing because they stem from a high affluence/low inequality national context that should be a particularly good case for failing to find such rich class perceptions.},

One strain of this research has situated the labor movement, and its decline, at the center of economic inequality's rise in the United States. Another has explored the labor movement's interconnections with political dynamics in the contemporary United States, including how labor's demise has reshaped the polity and policies. This body of scholarship also offers insights into recent stirrings of labor resurgence, ranging from the teachers' strikes of 2017 to the Fight for 15 minimum wage initiatives. Yet the field's reliance on official union membership rates as the standard measure of union strength, and on official strike statistics as the standard measure of union activism, prevents it from fully understanding the scope and durability of worker activism in the post-Wagner age.},

I address this question by investigating the effects of capital and trade flows on government welfare spending in fifty-three developing countries. Using an original measure of labor power in developing countries, I test the links between international markets, labor's political strength, and the welfare state. I argue that labor's collective-action problems, caused by large populations of low-skilled and surplus workers, offset labor's potential political gains from globalization. I show that when the proportion of low-skilled workers in a nation is high, globalization will lead to a decline in welfare spending. Most significantly, the results suggest that in nations where labor-market institutions are not yet well developed, government social-welfare spending is constrained by international market. forces]},

We show that union density varies considerably in Europe, ranging from 84 per cent in Denmark to 11 per cent in Portugal. Estimating identical models for each country, we find that individuals' probability of union membership is significantly affected by their personal characteristics, their attitudes and the characteristics of their workplace, whereas social factors seem to play a minor role. The presence of a union at the workplace and employees' attitudes concerning strong unions are the two variables most strongly associated with unionisation.},

Multisectoral associations like the CCE, the CMNH, Coparmex, and COECE are rare in the other large countries of the region. Three primary factors gave Mexican business stronger incentives to invest in these associations. First, Mexican business was excluded from elections, PRI politics, and appointments to top government positions and therefore relied more on associations to channel business's organized participation in politics and policy making. Second, in some periods, government actions were threatening to business interests and prompted defensive organization. Third, in other periods of closer cooperation between business and government, government officials relied heavily on these associations to mediate relations with business, giving big business further incentives to invest in associations.},

Random sampling is not typically a viable approach when the total number of cases to be selected is small. Hence attention to purposive modes of sampling is needed. Yet, while the existing qualitative literature on case selection offers a wide range of suggestions for case selection, most techniques discussed require in-depth familiarity of each case. Seven case selection procedures are considered, each of which facilitates a different strategy for within-case analysis. The case selection procedures considered focus on typical, diverse, extreme, deviant, influential, most similar, and most different cases. For each case selection procedure, quantitative approaches are discussed that meet the goals of the approach, while still requiring information that can reasonably be gathered for a large number of cases.},

This has helped the first generation of Taiwan's industrial workers adapt smoothly to industrial work but also has retarded the development of strong worker identity and the working-class movement.},

Consequently, this analysis sets out to disentangle the concept of corporatism and to suggest a replacement. It includes a comparative classification of 24 long\textendash term industrial democracies in terms of the corporatism scores given by 23 different scholarly analyses. The divisions in scoring certain important but problematic cases (such as Japan) can be explained by noting differing emphases in the term. I then propose an alternative, more focused summary measure of economic integration which is clearly linear and which has no `problem cases'. Precise scores on economic integration are given for four time periods from the late 1960s through the mid\textendash 1990s. It will be seen that the industrial democracies have always been dichotomised between integrated and non\textendash integrated (or `pluralist') economies.},

Examining the role of BBB in major Canadian labour law reform initiatives between the late 1980s and 2019, this article explores why the labour movement, despite the potential advantages of BBB, has not collectively pursued BBB reforms. It concludes with an analysis of the failure to incorporate BBB proposals into labour legislation and an assessment of the key challenges to adopting significant BBB reforms in the future. Earlier research concluded that BBB proposals in the 1990s failed because of employer opposition and lack of understanding, including by labour. `Ibis study departs from earlier conclusions to find that neither of these factors has been prominent regarding BBB in recent decades. Instead, lack of support for BBB arises from some unions' concerns about preserving existing representation rights, resistance to the prospect of mandatory councils of unions, and anticipation of jurisdictional conflicts. Lack of support for BBB from some peak labour organizations arises from a consensus approach to deciding which labour law reform issues to promote. An additional challenge to its adoption is the politicized nature of labour law reform, and the political cost of innovative and untried proposals deter governments from adopting BBB.},

  abstract = {This paper reviews several neo-Weberian ideas about social class for understanding patterns of men's career mobility. Special attention is devoted to the non-Marxist concepts of social class advocated by Giddens, Sorokin, and Parkin. Further insights are provided by an analysis of data for 20,000 men in the experienced American civilian labor force. The data are fit with a loglinear model and then further analyzed with multidimensional scaling techniques. The data analysis discloses three broad categories of social class that consist of farmers, manual, and nonmanual occupations. The findings also reveal further subdivisions in which professionals and skilled craft occupations form distinct classes within the nonmanual and manual categories. A third, much smaller, subdivision exists between semi-skilled operatives and unskilled laborers. These findings support neo-Weberian social class concepts. These results are also compared with Breiger's (1981) research on intergenerational mobility. This comparison shows that patterns in career mobility reveal a simpler picture of class structure than the eight class categories that Breiger reports for intergenerational mobility. The conceptual implications of these findings are discussed.},

El crecimiento industrial vinculado a la sustituci\'on de importaciones gener\'o altas tasas de movilidad ocupacional hacia posiciones manuales de alta calificaci\'on. \textquestiondown Hasta qu\`e punto la crisis y el cambio estructural a partir de los ochenta alteraron esta situaci\'on? Partiendo de dos encuestas (1965 y 2000), se identifican tres tendencias: la continuidad en la movilidad estructural ascendente; la reducci\'on de los ingresos laborales en las ocupaciones no manuales; y la permanencia de la inequidad social en el acceso a las oportunidades laborales. Estas tendencias sugieren que los cambios estructurales de las dos \'ultimas d\'ecadas arrojan un saldo negativo en la movilidad ocupacional, incluso en un caso que podr\'ia ser considerado un ejemplo de integraci\'on "exitosa" a las nuevas condiciones econ\'omicas en Am\`erica Latina. /// The author analyses long-term tendencies in occupational mobility in Monterrey. Industrial growth geared towards import substitution fostered high rates in occupational mobility to highly qualified manual labor. To what extent has this situation been modified by the crisis and structural change beginning in the eighties? Drawing data from two surveys (1965 and 2000), the author identifies three different tendencies: continuity in the ascending structural mobility; decreasing pay in non-manual labor; and a persistent social inequality in accessing job opportunities. Theses tendencies suggest that structural changes in the last two decades bear out a negative balance in occupational mobility, even in a case of "successful" incorporation to the new economic environment in Latin America.},

Este art\'iculo, basado en entrevistas semiestructuradas con 77 padres, revela que, en \~Nu\~noa, los padres eligen entre colegios particulares pagados y descartan la opci\'on de enviar a sus hijos a colegios municipales o subvencionados. Al contrario, los padres de La Florida eligen colegios subvencionados como una forma de evitar los peligros que perciben en los colegios municipales.

  abstract = {This book addresses some of the key issues in the field of comparative political economy and institutional theory: the role of history in institutional analysis, the dynamics of slow institutional change, the limitations of rational design and economic-functionalist explanations of institutional stability, and the recurrent difficulties of restraining the effects of capitalism on social order. In the classification of the `Varieties of Capitalism' school, Germany has always been taken as the chief exemplar of a `European', coordinated market economy. The book explores to what extent Germany actually conforms to this description. Its argument is supported by original empirical research on wage-setting and wage structure, the organization of business and labor in business associations and trade unions, social policy, public finance, and corporate governance. From this evidence, this book traces the current liberalization of the post-war economy of democratic capitalism by means of a historical approach to institutional change.},

We pay special attention to business income, which dominates at the top. Our analysis includes not only distributed profits, but also the large proportion of accrued profits retained by firms, which are rarely analyzed given the difficulty of identifying individual owners. Our most conservative top 1 percent income-share estimate is 15 percent\textemdash the fifth highest in the top incomes literature. When distributed profits are adjusted for evasion, the top 1 percent share reaches 22\textendash 26 percent. When we broaden the income concept to include accrued profits, which we impute to taxpayers using ownership shares calculated from business tax forms, the top 1 percent share increases to a minimum of 23 percent. Despite this impressive income concentration, the top 1 percent pays modest average effective income-tax rates of 15\textendash 16 percent.},

  abstract = {Despite the integration of telephone and VDU technologies, call centres are not uniform in terms of work organization. It is suggested that diversity can best be understood by reference to a range of quantitative and qualitative characteristics. Consequently, perspectives that treat all call centres as if they were the same hybrids of customization and routinization are rejected, along with over-optimistic interpretations of labour control over work organization. Empirical evidence from nine `workflows' in two call centres - an established financial sector organization and a rapidly growing outsourced operation - provide excellent grounds for an examination of similarity and difference. A picture emerges of workflows which are volume-driven and routinized, involving low levels of employee discretion, and, by contrast, those less dominated by quantitative criteria offering higher levels of operator discretion and an emphasis on the quality of customer service. Despite these distinctions, larger numbers of operators report an experience of work which is driven by quantitative imperatives, most manifest in the pervasive implementation of targets. Targets are also used increasingly to assess and mould the quality of the call centre operator's interaction with the customer. Overall, the evidence casts doubt on the optimistic perspective that call centre work, in time, will come to resemble `knowledge work'.},

Hypotheses on this are derived from class theory, collective action theory and organization theory. When examining them via a crossnational comparison of labor unions and business interest associations, class-specific differences arise: a higher organizability accrues to business interest associations in terms of the ability to recruit members, but to unions in terms of internalizing interests and making members comply. No theory's hypotheses are completely consistent with these findings. Their shortcomings are discussed, and a revised theoretical approach is developed. The paper's final section discusses some consequences of the observed differences for business' and unions' interest policies.},

The findings of the study reveal that: a) there are surprisingly low levels of support for neoliberal ideas across Europe; b) class (when conceptualized and operationalized more subtly) continues to be a very useful explanatory tool of relative ideological orientation; and c) social and institutional differences between northern and southern Europe are also reflected at the ideological level.},

  abstract = {El empresariado local goza de un capital econ\'omico, influencia pol\'itica y prestigio social impensados en Chile tres d\'ecadas atr\'as. A comienzos del r\'egimen de Pinochet (1973-1990), los empresarios eran un sector desarticulado, debilitado por el embate del Estado y de los actores sindicales, y traumatizado por las expropiaciones y el alzamiento de la Unidad Popular de Allende (1970 \textendash{} 1973). Tras la revoluci\'on neoliberal del r\'egimen militar, los empresarios se consolidaron como un grupo cohesionado, organizado tras poderosas asociaciones gremiales, y con un proyecto ideol\'ogico com\'un. Su actual riqueza y visibilidad responden no s\'olo a la bonanza econ\'omica de las \'ultimas d\'ecadas, sino tambi\'en a la forma que tom\'o el capitalismo chileno, en que empresas y empresarios gozan de un lugar protag\'onico. La reafirmaci\'on del modelo neoliberal durante los gobiernos de la Concertaci\'on (1990-2010) facilit\'o el florecimiento de este sector, reafirmando su posici\'on dominante. La elecci\'on del empresario Sebasti\'an Pi\~nera como Presidente de la Rep\'ublica en 2010 verific\'o esta tendencia. Este art\'iculo revisa las transformaciones experimentadas por el empresariado chileno en los \'ultimos treinta a\~nos, destacando algunos hitos en la expansi\'on del capitalismo chileno. Tomando como marco anal\'itico las cuatro fuentes de poder social que distingue Michael Mann (1986), revisa rasgos del poder econ\'omico, pol\'itico, coercitivo y simb\'olico que sustentan la posici\'on privilegiada del empresariado en Chile.},

  abstract = {Opposed theories of relations between business and government in advanced capitalist democracies are predicated on contrary assumptions concerning the capacity of the managers and directors of large corporations to act upon their political interests. An assumption of corporate rationality presumes that the corporate elite is largely incapable of identifying and promoting its common political objectives; an assumption of classwide rationality presumes that such a capacity is present. This article examines these and related assumptions about the internal social organization of the corporate elite in the United States and Great Britain. Inclusive and diffusely structured networks of economic and social relations among the largest corporations are found in both countries to provide a foundation for a special segment of the elite whose political interests transcend individual firms and whose internal cohesion facilitates expression of those interests in the political process. This politically dominant segment enters into contact with government in ways that favor promotion of classwide policies and disfavor more parochial outlooks. Challenge to the position of large business, whether from the labor movement in Great Britain or the national government in the United States, is shown to have further consolidated the political capacities of this segment. Though corporate rationality still characterizes much of the internal organization of the corporate community, classwide rationality now characterizes its highest circles.},

The author uses Dreher's (2006) globalization index, which gauges globalization on economic, social, and political dimensions, and Mosley's (2011) FACB rights index, which measures 37 aspects of both practices and laws violations of FACB rights, to examine the impact of globalization on FACB rights of workers. Using panel data for 142 developing countries during the 1985\textendash 2002 period, the author finds mixed evidence of the impact of globalization on FACB rights, controlling for a host of relevant factors, including endogeneity concerns using a System-GMM approach. While social globalization is associated with both strengthening laws and enforcing the laws to protect FACB rights, this is not the case for political globalization. In addition, the positive effect of economic globalization on FACB rights is sensitive to estimation specifications.},

Two analyses are computed, based on similarities of intergenerational mobility inflows and of residential patterns. In both analyses the farm versus nonfarm distinction is the most basic. The second level divides occupations into middle- and working-class clusters. These clusters lend support to a hypothesis of proletarianization of white-collar work; embourgeoisement, manual-nonmanual, middle-mass, and knowledge-technocracy theories are not supported. In both analyses, the majority of clericals and, in the second analysis, technicians are more similar to manual workers than to middle-class occupations. An analysis of friendship choices lends further support to the location of clericals among the working class. The results also document the promise of cluster analysis as a major analytical tool far analyzing social structures.},

Building upon the finding that while voters differ from nonvoters in their demographic attributes, their attitudes as measured by responses to survey questions are not distinctive, we consider a variety of political acts beyond voting that citizens can use to multiply their political input and to communicate more precise messages to policymakers. In addition, we consider not only respondents' demographic characteristics and policy attitudes but also their circumstances of economic deprivation and dependence upon government programs. Although activists are representative of the public at large in terms of their attitudes, they differ substantially in their demographic attributes, economic needs, and the government benefits they receive. Furthermore, in terms of the issues that animate participation, groups differentiated along these lines bring very different policy concerns to their activity.},

The chapter begins by using quantitative evidence to analyse the number and diffusion of social pacts over time and across countries, distinguished by type, scope, and content, before considering the difficulties involved in social pact institutionalization. The chapter compares social pacts with collective labour agreements, considers the differences between dyadic and triadic relationships, and traces the instability of social pacts in part to their discretionary as compared to rules-based character. The chapter presents five key hypotheses\textemdash derived from the functionalist, utilitarian, normative, and power-distributive approaches found in new institutionalist analysis\textemdash as to how, and via what kinds of mechanisms, social pact institutionalization may occur. Finally, the chapter considers why particular combinations of mechanisms are more likely than others.},

  abstract = {The literature on corporatism has presented much evidence associating highly centralized systems of collective bargaining with wage restraint and relatively successful macroeconomic performance. In addition, centralized bargaining is associated with relatively small wage differentials. This paper presents a model of the impact of centralized wage setting on both real wages and relative wages. The central assumption is that the centralization of wage setting at the national level unites unions who are complements in production. Since a wage increase for one group of workers negatively affects the welfare of other workers who are complements in production, centralized wage setters choose wages below the equilibrium of decentralized wage setting. It is also shown that if the union confederation maximizes a utilitarian welfare function with equal weights, centralized wage setting decreases wage dispersion. While low-paid workers clearly gain from centralized bargaining, high-paid workers may prefer that bargaining be decentralized.},

Many observers have recently argued that such corporatist bargaining institutions are everywhere being undermined by changes in the global economy. The authors, using data from a wide variety of primary and secondary sources, test whether changes in patterns of wage-setting in the private sector are consistent with that claim. Although they find some signs that corporatist wage-setting institutions are in decline, they also find offsetting signs of the resiliency of such institutions. Overall, the evidence does not indicate that wage-setting in the private sector is undergoing a general process of decentralization in these eight countries.},

Several distinct threads have developed, largely in isolation from each other. The authors suggest that the various accounts implicitly rely on different definitions of class politics and propose a way to classify them. The classification is based on two questions: first, whether changes in the strength of the left depend on the working class specifically or on cross-class dynamics and, second, whether emergent class differences in politics are largely spontaneous or constructed. The authors use this classification to assess the prospects for testing the empirical implications of different accounts and point to the more general insights potentially offered by each approach.},

  abstract = {This article explores the relationship between different forms of autonomy, categorized into ``job control'' and ``schedule control,'' and measures of subjective well-being, using UK panel data from Understanding Society. Levels of autonomy differ considerably among UK employees. Managers report the greatest autonomy. Professionals, especially women, and less skilled occupations report substantially less. Panel probit, analysis of covariance, and change-score analysis evidence not only the positive impact of autonomy but also the differentiated and gendered relationship between autonomy and subjective well-being measures. Job control, including over tasks and pace of work, increases job and leisure satisfaction. Autonomy over work manner increases leisure and life satisfaction, but only among women. Informal schedule control has positive impacts on job (men and women) and life (men only) satisfaction.},

The article relies on Cohort-based models of social change in concert with a theory linking New Left social movements of the 1960s and 1970s to the diffusion of new life-course patterns. Further, it addresses the question of diffusion across sociodemographic dimensions as cohabitation rates increase. Analyzing retrospective lifecourse data on three cohorts born between 1943 and 1964, I find that later cohorts are much more likely to have cohabited than are earlier cohorts, that left-oriented political activism is a strong predictor of cohabitation for all cohorts, and that there has been some demographic diffusion of cohabitation along the education dimension.},

  abstract = {This study explores a series of predictions concerning the likely changes in the American class structure in the 1970s made by Wright and Singelmann in their work on proletarianization. They argued that, in a period of economic stagnation such as occurred in the 1970s, there should be an acceleration of the process of proletarianization and a decline in the expansion of managerial and semiautonomous employee (or expert) locations in the class structure. These changes should occur both because of an intensification of proletarianization within economic sectors and because of decline in the shift of employment into the relatively less proletarianized sectors such as the state. On the basis of the data used in this study, none of these predictions is supported. Indeed, the evidence indicates a decisive acceleration of the growth of managerial class locations in the 1970s and a clear deproletarianization within and across economic sectors. These findings are interpreted as a result of two principal factors: the internationalization of American class relations during the 1970s and the effect of technological and organizational changes in production on clases in the United States.},

This article argues that the reverse-J curve is itself the result of two distinct kinds of effects of workers' power on capitalists' interests: one, a negative effect, in which workers' power undermines the capacity of capitalists to unilaterally make various kinds of decisions, and the second, a positive effect, in which workers' power helps capitalists solve the various kinds of collective action problems they face.},

  abstract = {I examine the challenges of conceptualization and measurement of structural power when the differential power of industries or individual firms are in question. While ascertaining structural power's operation at this level can be very challenging, I point to some issues of conceptualization and measurement that can enhance our analytic leverage at the initial stages of the research process. Specifically I propose a more refined language of ``structural prominence'' to differentiate between the expected causes of structural power from its hypothesized effects. Using a variety of data I show that researchers have some simple tools at their disposal but must pay careful attention to basic logical inferential limitations when examining structural power arguments. Through an examination of firms' reactions to policy proposals in US securities regulation I find positive evidence for structural power operating in initial policy proposals. When I examine levels of preference attainment in the policymaking process itself, structural power appears to be playing a weaker and more conditional role. I also find that the preference attainment of firms is greatest when structural and instrumental forces operate in conjunction, a finding supportive of recent research in this area.},
